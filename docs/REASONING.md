# Reasoning Log

This document logs the reasoning behind additions, removals, and reorganization of content in the Awesome Microsoft Ecosystem list.

## Curation Principles

The following principles guide the curation process:

1. **Relevance**: All resources must be relevant to the Microsoft ecosystem (.NET, C#, Azure, etc.).
2. **Quality**: Prioritize well-maintained, documented, and actively supported resources.
3. **Uniqueness**: Emphasize unusual, specialized, or obscure tools that may not be widely known but provide significant value.
4. **Organization**: Ensure logical grouping and categorization for easy navigation.
5. **Description Clarity**: Provide concise but informative descriptions that clearly explain the purpose of each resource.

## Addition Reasoning

### May 24, 2024

#### New Focus: Developer Productivity Tools

**Reasoning**: Developer productivity tools can significantly enhance the development workflow, saving time and reducing errors. Many specialized tools exist within the Microsoft ecosystem that provide unique capabilities beyond what is commonly known or used. Adding these to the list helps developers discover tools that can improve their development experience.

**Additions**:
- **Roslyn.CodeDom** - Added as it provides a modern approach to CodeDom using Roslyn, which is valuable for code generation scenarios while maintaining compatibility with existing CodeDom consumers.
- **Scripty** - Included because it leverages C# scripts for code generation, allowing developers to use familiar C# syntax and the full power of Roslyn for compile-time code generation.
- **Forge** - Added as it offers a unique templating approach to code generation in C#, providing more flexibility than traditional T4 templates.

#### New Focus: Security and Cryptography Libraries

**Reasoning**: Security is a critical concern for all applications, and specialized security libraries can help developers implement proper security measures more easily. The .NET ecosystem has several specialized security and cryptography libraries that go beyond the standard libraries provided by Microsoft.

**Additions**:
- **Geralt** - Added because it provides high-performance cryptography operations with a modern API design, offering better performance than standard .NET cryptography libraries for certain scenarios.
- **CryptoNet** - Included as it simplifies common cryptographic operations with an easy-to-use API, making security implementations more accessible to developers.
- **BCrypt.NET-Next** - Added as it is a well-maintained implementation of the BCrypt password hashing algorithm, which is critical for secure password storage.

#### New Section: Specialized Data Structures

**Reasoning**: Many specialized data structures exist in the .NET ecosystem that are optimized for specific use cases. These implementations often provide better performance or functionality than the standard collections but are less well-known. This section highlights these specialized implementations to help developers choose the most appropriate data structure for their specific needs.

**Additions**:
- **C5** - Added because it provides a comprehensive set of generic collection types that extend beyond what is available in the standard library. Its persistent tree implementations are particularly useful for functional programming patterns in C#.
- **Wintellect.PowerCollections** - Included due to its robust implementations of specialized collections that aren't available in the standard library, such as MultiDictionary and OrderedDictionary.
- **TrieNet** - Added as it provides efficient implementations of Trie and Patricia Trie data structures, which are valuable for prefix-based lookups and auto-complete functionality.

#### New Section: Performance & Optimization Tools

**Reasoning**: Performance optimization is a critical concern for many .NET applications, especially in high-throughput or resource-constrained environments. This section collects tools that help developers identify, analyze, and resolve performance issues.

**Additions**:
- **Spreads** - Added because it provides highly optimized data structures for time series processing, which is valuable for financial and IoT applications.
- **LinqAF** - Included as it offers a unique approach to LINQ that focuses on array fusion to minimize allocations, providing better performance for intensive data processing.
- **LayoutFarm** - Added as a specialized HTML layout engine written in C# that offers an alternative to the standard web rendering approaches.

#### Enhanced Content: Azure Development Tools

**Reasoning**: As Azure continues to grow in importance within the Microsoft ecosystem, developers need specialized tools to work effectively with Azure services, especially during local development and testing.

**Additions**:
- **Azurite** - Added as it provides a lightweight local version of Azure Storage, which is essential for developing and testing applications that use Azure Storage without requiring an actual Azure subscription.
- **Azure Functions Host** - Included because it allows developers to understand and potentially extend the runtime environment for Azure Functions.
- **YARP** - Added as it represents Microsoft's official approach to building high-performance reverse proxy applications, which is particularly useful for microservices architectures.

## Reorganization Reasoning

### May 21, 2024

#### Restructured: Testing Tools Section

**Reasoning**: The previous organization mixed different types of testing tools without clear differentiation. The new structure separates unit testing frameworks, mocking libraries, and specialized testing tools to make it easier for developers to find the specific type of testing tool they need.

#### Enhanced: Cloud & Distributed Systems Section

**Reasoning**: The previous organization didn't adequately reflect the diverse range of tools available for cloud and distributed systems development. The new structure provides clearer subcategories for service mesh, deployment orchestration, and monitoring, making it easier for developers to navigate to the specific type of tool they're looking for.
