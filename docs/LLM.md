# LLM Guidance for Awesome Microsoft Ecosystem

This document provides guidance for LLMs working with this repository to maintain and enhance the "Awesome Microsoft Ecosystem" list.

## Loop Process

As an LLM working with this repository, you should follow this loop process:

1. **Exploration**: Explore the Microsoft ecosystem to find unusual, obscure, specialized open-source projects, tools, and resources.
   - Focus on .NET, C#, Azure, and related technologies
   - Search for projects that are useful but not widely known
   - Document your exploration process in `docs/EXPLORATION.md`

2. **Curation**: Organize and curate the list in `README.md`.
   - Ensure logical organization by categories and subcategories
   - Maintain alphabetical order within sections
   - Follow the formatting guidelines in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`

3. **Quality Audit**: Verify links and facts.
   - Check that all links are working
   - Ensure descriptions are accurate and informative
   - Validate that projects are still maintained or relevant

4. **Documentation**: Keep detailed logs.
   - Document reasoning for additions/changes in `docs/REASONING.md`
   - Update the changelog in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
   - Update this LLM guidance document with any new insights

5. **Enhancement**: Improve the list.
   - Add new sections if needed
   - Enhance descriptions for clarity
   - Ensure cross-referencing between related sections

6. **Repeat**: Continue the loop process with each iteration.

## Guidelines for Resource Selection

When selecting resources to add to the list:

- **Relevance**: Must be relevant to the Microsoft ecosystem
- **Quality**: Prioritize well-maintained, documented resources
- **Uniqueness**: Emphasize unusual, specialized tools
- **Value**: Focus on resources that provide significant value to developers

## Formatting Standards

- Resource Format: `- [Name](URL) - Description.`
- Add additional links if relevant: `[Website](URL)` or `[Documentation](URL)`
- Keep descriptions concise (1-2 sentences) but informative
- End descriptions with a period
- Maintain alphabetical order within sections

## Last Exploration Focus

The last exploration focused on specialized .NET libraries, Azure tools, and obscure Microsoft ecosystem projects. Future explorations should consider:

- Developer productivity tools
- Testing and quality assurance libraries
- Security and cryptography implementations
- Low-level system programming tools
- Machine learning and AI libraries in the .NET ecosystem
- Game development tools and frameworks
- IoT and embedded system libraries

## Current Organization

The list is currently organized into major sections including:

- .NET Core & Framework
- C# Libraries & Tools
- Cloud & Distributed Systems
- Data & Storage
- Reactive Programming
- Code Analysis & Compilation
- Utilities & Helpers

Consider maintaining this structure while adding new subsections as needed.

## Previous Additions

The most recent additions focused on:
- Specialized data structures (C5, TrieNet, PowerCollections)
- Performance optimization tools (Spreads, LinqAF)
- Azure development tools (Azurite, Azure Functions Host, YARP)

Future iterations should explore different areas to maintain a comprehensive coverage of the Microsoft ecosystem.
